Git Workflow Tutorial
---------------------

This tutorial provides a basic workflow for using Git, from cloning a repository to safely working with branches.

Setting Up Your Workspace
-------------------------

*******Cloning the Repository*******

    git clone https://github.com/beo1259/WCSIBM
    cd repository

Working with Branches
---------------------

*******Checking Out a Branch*******

To switch to an existing branch:
    git checkout branch_name

To create a new branch and switch to it:
    git checkout -b new_branch_name

*******Updating Your Branch*******

It's a good practice to keep your branch updated with the main branch:

    git checkout branch_name
    git pull origin main

Resolve any conflicts that arise before moving forward!!!

*******Pushing Changes*******

After committing your changes on the feature branch, push them to the remote repository:

    git push origin branch_name

Merging Changes Safely
----------------------

Pull Request (GitHub) or Merge Request (GitLab)
When your feature is complete, push your branch and create a Pull Request or Merge Request in your repository's web interface.

Code Review
Have team members review your changes, run automated tests, and ensure everything is in order.

*******Handling Merge Conflicts*******

If there are conflicts with the main branch, resolve them locally on your branch:

    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/main

Fix the conflicts and then commit the changes:

    git commit -am "Resolved conflicts with main"
    git push origin branch_name

*******Merging into Main*******

Once your PR/MR is approved and conflicts are resolved, merge it into the main branch through the web interface.

*******Cleaning Up*******

After the merge, delete the remote feature branch and pull the latest main branch:
    git branch -d branch_name               # Delete local branch
    git push origin --delete branch_name    # Delete remote branch
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
